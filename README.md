## Hello strangers who want to know about me (for some reason)

★・ᶻz- Feel free to call me either Milo, Kai or Elias

★・ᶻz- I am a minor, do not be weird to me or interact if you are an adult 

★・ᶻz- I am unlabeled, asexual and omniromantoc (still questiong my romantic identity, but thats what I'm sticking with for now)

★・ᶻz- I use any pronouns, but nothing feminine. Meopronouns are perferred

★・ᶻz- Since this is just for Pony Town, I would love to interact with people, but please be aware that I am horrible at talking to people

★・ᶻz- *continued form my bio since i ran out of space: the other two blogs are more personal, and I don't feel comfortable letting anyone I know irl yet. There's nothing bad on them, but just more personal than my main blog. I hope you understand :]
